Hi there!

On `{{ date }}`, `{{ meetup group }}` is having a lightning talks ‚ö°Ô∏èüó£ session. We want to hear from you. Yes, **you!**. All levels of experience and knowledge are welcome! If you‚Äôre new to speaking, we are happy to help.

What are you working on? What's something interesting you've just learned? A 10 minute lightning talk is a great way to share your knowledge and help other people learn something new.

Our format is: Elevator Pitch; Short demo (10 minutes!); Credit where it's due. You can read more here: https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Show-Your-Work#show-your-work.

If you're keen, or if you have questions, get in touch with us at `{{ contact details }}`. :)


Regards,
