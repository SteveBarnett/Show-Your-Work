Hello! :)

Thanks for wanting to get involved in the Show Your Work session. \o/

Have you had a look at our SYW format and have an idea for your demo? The format is: Elevator Pitch; Short demo (5 minutes!); Credit where it's due. You can read more here: https://github.com/SteveBarnett/Show-Your-Work#show-your-work.

One of the things we do for our speakers is have a dry run: a practice session before the real thing where we give constructive feedback, help with timing, that kind of thing. When do you have about 30 minutes free (before `{{ date }}`!) to do a dry run and chat?

Regards,

`{{ the organisers }}`
